The **alphas** and **omegas** have fought on about the most fashionable way to strut the jean for centuries. Many pants were stained by the blood of highly-opinionated dinos. It would take one beast with a good taste in hats to end this conflict.

You are on a quest to find the **Dappersaurus**â€”and thus, *findasaur*!

Basically this is a Where's Wally rip-off with randomly generated scenes for you have fun with. We didn't use any libraries or engines for game dev because we're fucking dumb. Made in 24 hours and a hangover for AstonHack 2017 by Alex Howell, Matthew Barber and Matthew Barlow.
